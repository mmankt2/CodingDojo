MySQL Worksheet (please complete and turn this in before you leave on Friday)


Your Name: Melissa Littleton

Understanding how to write basic SQL queries is extremely important.  Please find someone else in your cohort to work on the following challenges.  Please write down the appropriate SQL query on this worksheet and turn this in (before the end of the day).
  

1. Basic 4 Queries
For the ERD on the left, how would you:
1. Get all users whose age is greater than 35?
select id from users
where age > 35

2. Insert a new user whose first name is ‘Jonathan’ and last name is ‘Smith’?  Have created_at be the current time.
inser into users (first_name, last_name, created_at)
value ('Jonathan', 'Smith',NOW())

3. Delete all users whose user records were created after August 1st 2010?
Delect * from users where created_at > '2010-08-01'

4. Update user record (id: 3) so that first_name is ‘Coding’ and last name ‘Dojo’.  Also update it so that the age is set as 7.  Have updated_at automatically update to the current time.
update users
set first_name='Coding', last_name='Dojo', updated_at = NOW()
where id=3;

Once you do the four queries above, please check with at least one or two other groups before working on the following assignments.
--functions:
--CONCAT()
--CONCAT_WS()
--LENGTH()
--LOWER()
--HOUR()
--DAYNAME()
--MONTH()
--NOW()
--DATE_FORMAT()
