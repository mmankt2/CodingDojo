Created a requirements.txt file that can re-create the exact versions of all packages in my virtual environment. 
The 'pip freeze' command shows the list of packages and their versions in a way that they can be installed easily.
The 'pip list' command shows packages in the virtual environment or in the normal environment.  
  There are fewer packages in my virtual environment than in the normal environment.  
  The virtual environment only has 5 packages. 
'pip install Django==1.11.9' will install the Django package in my virtual environment on version 1.11.9.
'deactivate' closes the virtual environment'
The second time I ran 'pip install Django==1.11.9' the stdout said the packages were already installed, so nothing happened.
